  <div>
    👋🏻 Hi! Welcome to Block Two! Well done on all successfully completing Block One! 🎉
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Let's start by reviewing the README.md for Block Two on the Block Two GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2023">https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2023</a>. Don't forget to make note of the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2023#block-2-assessment">assessment schedule</a> in your own calendars. As you know from Block One, assessment will be upon you before you know it! Tutorials will continue as normal on Monday mornings. All lectures are now in the morning.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's continue by looking at the wiki for Block Two on the Block Two GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2023/wiki">https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2023/wiki</a>, paying particular attention to the reading list wiki page: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2023/wiki/Reading-List"></a>
  </div>
  <div>
    As mentioned on the wiki linked to on the previous slide, the textbook for this unit is <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/tcswift/apple-game-frameworks-and-technologies/">Apple Game Frameworks and Technologies</a> by <a href="https://tammycoron.com">Tammy Coron</a>. Make sure to <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/tcswift/apple-game-frameworks-and-technologies/#resources">download the resources for the book - including starter projects for each chapter</a>. Make note of <a href="https://devtalk.com/books/apple-game-frameworks-and-technologies/errata">the errata (or mistake list) for the book</a> - check this if you find something that doesn't seem to work or make sense.
  </div>
  <div>Over the course of this unit we are going to build three games - each of which could be a useful template for the app that you develop individually for the Product Two Unit.</div>
  <div>
    Read the Foreword, Acknowledgements, Preface and Get Ready for Game Development sections of the textbook.
  </div>
  <div>
    Read and complete the activities in Chapter One of the textbook: "Creating Scenes with Sprites and Nodes".
  </div>
  <div>
    Read and complete the activities in Chapter Two of the textbook: "Adding Animation and Movement with Actions".
