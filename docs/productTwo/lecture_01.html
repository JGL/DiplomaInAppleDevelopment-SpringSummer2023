  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    What are we going to be doing in Product Two? This time It's a solo brief around play - making a playful app for the Toad Bakery in Camberwell. Let's take this opportunity to review the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2023/wiki/Reading-List#product-two-individual-app-design-and-launch">reading list for the unit on the Block Two wiki</a>.
  </div>
  <div>As mentioned on the wiki - you should be making use of the <a href="https://education-static.apple.com/coding-club-kit/appworkbook.key">App Design Workbook</a> throughout the unit. You are going to have to make a 30 minute presentation at the end of this unit. Your aim should be to have a fully launched app by the end of the Block, subject to approval by the Toad Bakery client. You <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing-your-app-for-beta-testing-and-releases">should use TestFlight to release and test your app with select users</a>. I'm currently investigating how to get you app store access via the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/university/">iOS Developer University Program</a>.</div>
  <div>To be clear, it's up to you to keep developing your individual app through the remainder of this unit - I'm going to be teaching you technologies that I think will be useful, but you should be asking me for support in tutorials when you need it. The aim is to be as close as possible to a real solo app developer practice.</div>
  <div>We are going to start with SwiftUI and then move onto Augmented Reality technologies, before finishing with App distribution, unless there are requests for other technologies - have a think amongst yourselves!</div>
  <div>We are going to start this unit by learning about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a>, the latest api for creating User Interfaces in the Apple ecosystem.</div>
  <div>The first tutorial we are going to complete is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui-concepts">Learning SwiftUI</a>.</div>
  <div>Please complete the following sections from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui-concepts">Learning SwiftUI</a> tutorial (N.B. you will need the latest Xcode from Apple to complete this tutorial - Xcode 14 or above - not the Xcode 14 beta as the tutorial states):
